# RefresherAssignmentMT22
This is my repository for the year 3 MBIOL refresher assignment for MT22. It contains all the files necessary to run the code, which aims to analyse William soy bean yields under water stress and sulphur dioxide treatments. Main effects and interaction effects will be explored. Figures and tables are accessible in the outputs folder.
